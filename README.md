# Winter Theme Chrome Extension

## A cool winter themed extension for chrome browser

This is my first browser extension ever. It is a cool winter themed extension with falling snow animation and a nice new tab look. Also there is some hacker news and spotify player on the new tab. The extension can also freeze tabs, and it automatically freezes tabs that are inactive for more than 5 minutes. You can disable snow if you like and also play a cool freeze animation on any tab.
